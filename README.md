The aim of this project is to offer AT&T and stakeholders actionable insights into improving service delivery, enhancing customer satisfaction, and maintaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving telecommunications industry. By analyzing trends in customer satisfaction, where AT&T Fiber leads with a high index score, and assessing its market share and financial health through ARPU analysis, the project identifies strengths, opportunities for growth, and areas requiring strategic intervention. The outputs, encapsulated in detailed visualizations, present a clear picture of AT&T's performance dynamics, serving as a basis for strategic planning, marketing optimization, and product innovation to meet current and future customer needs and industry challenges.
